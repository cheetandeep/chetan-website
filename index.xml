      <description>Hey there! I&amp;rsquo;m Chetan and my story is of an immigrant who got a chance to live and work in three different countries around the world and finally decided to settle down in Toronto, Canada.
I work as a Cloud consultant and specialize in multi cloud architecture and automation. I help organizations and people embrace their cloud journey.
For the past 12 years I have been working with organizations of different shapes and sizes ranging from an early stage startup to a well established Enterprise operating in different domains - fintech, security, automaker, telecom, banking.</description>
