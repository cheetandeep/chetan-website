                <p>Hey there! I&rsquo;m Chetan and my story is of an immigrant who got a chance to live and work in three different countries around the world and finally decided to settle down in Toronto, Canada.</p>
<p>I work as a Cloud consultant and specialize in multi cloud architecture and automation. I help organizations and people embrace their cloud journey.</p>
<p>For the past 12 years I have been working with organizations of different shapes and sizes ranging from an early stage startup to a well established Enterprise operating in different domains - fintech, security, automaker, telecom, banking.</p>
<p>My humble beginnings were of a Unix administrator who started his career with an Enterprise organization right after graduating in Computer Science.</p>
<p>In 2016 I decided to move to Australia and landed my first professional job abroad with <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/">Bureau of Meteorology</a> as a Senior Linux Engineer. It was quite a fulfilling role as the team I was working for was responsible for managing BOM&rsquo;s infrastructure and making sure the Australian public has round the clock access to the weather data. I was working with different distros of Linux - Fedora, Ubuntu, RedHat to name some and it&rsquo;s when I started working with Amazon Web Services and automation (Terraform, Ansible)</p>
<p>Nature has its own plans and it was 2019 when we decided to migrate again this time to Canada. We had a hard time deciding which coast to settle in - East or West and finally we made Toronto our home.</p>
<p>My experience here in North America has primarily been helping organizations build their cloud infrastructure following industry best practices and standards while also having a keen eye on security.</p>
<p>I provide consulting on various facets of cloud engineering for managed offerings from both Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services. I help organizations architect their cloud infrastructure, automate the build process, build SRE/DevOps practices and help accelerate their cloud journey.</p>

<li>Database: Google Cloud Spanner, Google Cloud SQL, Amazon RDS</li>
<li>In-memory data store: Google Memorystore, Amazon Elasticache</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond work I am a husband and a proud father who loves spending free time with his family. We all love going out for hikes and bicycle rides. I also play Cricket sometimes but have to admit I am not very good at it.</p>
